## Safety — Never Run Destructive Commands

> Dangerous commands are actively monitored.
> Critical/high risk commands trigger error notifications in real-time.

- **NEVER** run `rm -rf`, `del /s`, `rmdir`, `format`, or any command that deletes files/directories without EXPLICIT user approval.
- **NEVER** run `DROP TABLE`, `DELETE FROM`, `TRUNCATE`, or any destructive database operation.
- **NEVER** run `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, or any command that rewrites history.
- **NEVER** run `npm publish`, `docker rm`, `terraform destroy`, or any irreversible deployment/infrastructure command.
- **NEVER** pipe remote scripts to shell (`curl | bash`, `wget | sh`).
- **ALWAYS** ask the user before running commands that modify system state, install packages, or make network requests.
- When in doubt, **show the command first** and wait for approval.

**Stack:** Unknown stack

## Project Standards

- convention in .gitignore
- Version your API from day 1 (/api/v1/)
- Use consistent response format across all endpoints
- Implement soft delete for important data — don't hard delete without confirmation
- Handle timezone correctly — store UTC, display in user's timezone
- Make layouts responsive from the start — mobile-first approach
- Disable submit button during form submission — prevent double-submit
- Always add empty states ("No items yet" with call-to-action)

## Verified Best Practices

- Agent generates new migration for every change (squash related changes)
- Agent installs packages without checking if already installed
- [Docker] Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size
- [Docker] Don't run as root in containers (use USER directive)

## Available Tools (ON-DEMAND only)
- `sys_core_01(q)` — Deep search when stuck
- `sys_core_05(query)` — Full-text lookup
> Context above IS your context. Do NOT call sys_core_14() at startup.
